# Claude Code Guidelines

## Working Principles

1. **Think first, read the codebase** - Always read relevant files before making changes. Never speculate about code you haven't opened.

2. **Check in before major changes** - Before any significant modifications, verify the plan with the user.

3. **Communicate clearly** - Provide high-level, concise explanations of changes made at each step.

4. **Keep it simple** - Every change should impact as little code as possible. Avoid massive or complex changes. Simplicity is paramount.

5. **Maintain documentation** - Keep architecture documentation up to date (see ARCHITECTURE.md).

6. **No speculation** - Never make claims about code without investigating first. Give grounded, hallucination-free answers.
