# Claude Operating Rules (You.Prjct)

1) First think through the problem. Read the codebase for relevant files before answering.
2) Before any major change, propose a plan and wait for approval.
3) After each change, provide a high-level, concise summary of what changed and why.
4) Keep changes as small as possible. Avoid refactors unless explicitly requested.
5) Keep documentation updated (docs/ARCHITECTURE.md and docs/WORKPLAN.md).
6) Never speculate about files you haven’t opened. If a file is referenced, read it first.
7) Prefer feature work to ship in small PRs with a clear test checklist.
